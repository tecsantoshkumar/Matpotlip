========

- Should plot data in log scale instead of only linear.
- Should be able to use more than one data source for the same figure (each
  data source with its own subplots).
- Integrate better with `outputty`'s import plugins (`table.read(plugin_name)`)
  so we can use a lot of data sources.
- Create a `plot` plugin to `outputty`.
- Pack and send it to PyPI.
- Should have a way to set xmin, xmax, ymin and ymax
- `aggregate` should work on `Plotter.bar`
